Tell me about your experience:

My name is Tenzin Dorji, I am from Bhutan. I did my graduation in Electronics and Communications from  India.
I started my career in Accenture India in the year 2012 and worked there for 4 years. In 2015,
I got opportunity to move to New Jersey to work
from client location Merck(Pharma Company).  My primary role was design, maintenance, support on prem web infrastructure.
Also designed and provisioned stacks to host website and applications especially java base application in on prem infrastructure.

I used to provide my expertise to dev team with hosting issues on 4000 plus websites.
I did lot of complex redirections, and migrated around 20 on perm website to Cloud.

I was primary technical point of contact of www.merck.com. I also created jenkin pipeline for
deployment and releases since content update request is very high. Due to pipeline, release and deployment was fast and simless for client.
This was one of the mile stone achievement for the client.


I created couple of automations during this tenure like log rotation, system monitoring usage like CPU, Disk and memory.
This help greatly during oncall and was able to detects issues before users reports.

Then gradually I took up additional roles on AWS Cloud, Pivotal Cloud Foundry and change management.
Later my role was mostly on Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and there I used to automate infrastructure deployment, user provisioning
patching and upgrade, set up monitoring.

I used to worked closing with clients, platform team and offshore team.


Beginning of last year, I got opportunity to come to bay area through Kforce to work for Intuit.
Here I am working as SRE for Financial Data Platform team. This is an infrastructure layer between Intuit
production like turbo tax, mint, quick-books and Financial institutions.
There are around 60 plus services using financial Data platform. We have a team of 12 SREs in US and 5 in India.
We provide support to dev team, perform deployment, setup monitoring, maintain infrastructure, upgrade, patching
, security fixes, creating automations, and also migration.

We follow two types of deployment model. One using chef which is old way of deployment and another is through spinnaker UI
Both model follows blue and green deployment for zero down time.

I also upgrade the splunk forwarder from IHP to AWS.

I took up responsibility to reduce signal to noise ratio, we were getting 100s of noisy alerts every
day like 6 months ago, now we get less alerts and are actual alerts.

Also, I took up responsibility to optimize AWS cost for entire financial data platform area.

We have 24/7 on-call support.

More over, I am a good team player. 





I love photography, like to travel a lot and also like to cook.  I loved to play Tennis and Ping Pong.


What I observed here in California is its diversity and I was really amazed by it.

I lived by the Moto “Be true to yourself, that’s the secret of happiness”.
